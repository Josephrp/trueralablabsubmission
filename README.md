## Abstract

This paper presents an approach for multimodal application performance optimization using the TruEra Machine Learning Ops platform for model evaluation. 5 Vision Models, 5 Audio Models, and 5 Text Models were evaluated based on prompting, performance, and various sequential configurations to produce the best downstream outcomes based on human evaluation. The selected configuration and prompts are available in a demo here.

## Problem Statement

Enterprise application prototypers face the problem that each model is a little bit different. Some novel functions or capabilities can also drastically improve an agentâ€™s performance. Multimodality compounds this issue and makes assessments all the more time-consuming and technically challenging. Intel, Google Vertex, Milvus, and TruEra, provide models, model serving, retrieval-augmented generation, and evaluation, respectively. But what is their optimal configuration for a given demo?

## Literature Review

We have selected as many models as time allowed which was 7 days. Some models had endpoints in huggingface, others in Google Vertex. We also fine-tuned models described below.

## Methods

This study aimed to evaluate the performance of various vision, audio, and text models in producing downstream outcomes, with a focus on human-centered applications. The evaluation was structured around three main axes: prompting strategies, performance metrics, and sequential configurations of the models. The models were assessed based on their ability to process and generate information in their respective domains (vision, audio, text) and their effectiveness in integrated applications.

### Global Evaluation Criteria

The models were evaluated based on the following criteria:

- **Prompting**: The effectiveness of different prompting strategies in eliciting accurate and relevant responses from the models.
- **Performance**: Quantitative metrics such as accuracy, speed, and error rate were used to assess the performance of each model.
- **Sequential Configurations**: The models were combined in various sequential configurations to determine the most effective combinations for specific tasks.

### Human Evaluation

The ultimate measure of each model's effectiveness was based on human evaluation. A panel of n=1 with domain-specific knowledge assessed the outputs for relevance, accuracy, and utility.

### Using TruEra For Multimodal AI Application Lifecycle Evaluation

#### Initial Phase

In the early stages of application development, TruEra assists in data preparation, input selection and engineering, model architecture choice, and hyperparameter tuning. This foundational support is crucial for building robust models.

#### Model Evaluation and Improvement

Post-development, models are introduced to the TruEra platform for quality assessment. The platform's diagnostic capabilities enable users to identify and rectify weaknesses, thereby enhancing model strength and reliability.

#### Deployment and Continuous Improvement

Once a model meets the desired criteria, it is deployed into the production environment. TruEra's monitoring tools play a critical role in this phase, offering ongoing support and insights for continuous model improvement.
